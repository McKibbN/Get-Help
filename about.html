      <div class="History">
        <h4><strong>Get Help Dealers</strong> was established in the grand year 0f 2008 after our founder, Austin Gregory-Thompson McHelp, left his home in pursuit of helping those in need of transportation.
        He had trekked for years looking for decent car dealer that would give him decent cars with fair prices, but alas, it was a lost cause.
        He then took up the montra of finding cars that would be discarded and regarded as trash and recycling them into the public masses.
        If there was a car that was about to be sold for scrap, junked, or left to rot in the sun, you bet your bottom dollar that he was there to find another man low on his luck and in need of some wheels.
        If it weren't for Austin, a whopping 14% of the lower class in Austin, Texas would be without a way to blaze their own trails in the beautiful country.
        Sure the cars may not be beautiful themselves, but Austin believes in every set of wheels to pull their weight and give it their all to the one behind the wheel.
        Now do you want a car, or do you <strong>want</strong> a car?
